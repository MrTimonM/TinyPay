# 🚀 START HERE - TinyPay REAL MODE

## ✅ REAL MODE IS NOW ACTIVE!

I've converted your TinyPay project to **REAL interactive mode** where you can actually click nodes to forward transactions and broadcast to Aptos!

---

## 🎯 What's Different Now

### ❌ BEFORE (Demo/Simulation):
- Fake animated flow
- No real transactions
- Just visual demo

### ✅ NOW (REAL Mode):
- **REAL signed transactions** with your private key
- **Click nodes to forward** actual transaction data
- **Broadcast to Aptos Devnet** when you click the online node
- **0.1 APT actually transferred** on-chain
- **Real Explorer links** to verify

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (2 Commands)

### Terminal 1: Start Backend API
```bash
cd backend
npm run server
```

**Wait for:**
```
🚀 TinyPay API Server running on http://localhost:3001
✅ Ready for real transactions!
```

### Terminal 2: Start Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

**Then open:** http://localhost:3000

---

## 🎮 How to Use

### 1. **Create Transaction (User Node)**
   - Enter recipient address (try: `0xe23bceaed51c4268300174ad8cd4d4f27750b53a5ef41277defa9f28898b5ebd`)
   - Click **"🔐 Create Signed Transaction"**
   - Uses your private key: `0x7e76b51...`
   - Amount: **0.1 APT** (as you requested)

### 2. **Click Merchant 1** 🏪
   - Transaction forwards to first offline merchant
   - Original signature preserved
   - No internet needed

### 3. **Click Merchant 2** 🏬
   - Transaction continues forwarding
   - Adds to forwarding chain
   - Still offline

### 4. **Click Merchant 3** 🏦 **← THIS BROADCASTS TO APTOS!**

## 🔧 Configuration

### Your Private Key (Hardcoded)
Located in `frontend/src/App_Real.tsx`:
```typescript
const USER_PRIVATE_KEY = '0x7e76b51ec4a5ad62a4957f605c97e1d4a1cb6f5b602723f04bcf19f33776b978';
```

### Amount (Fixed)
**0.1 APT** as you requested

### Contract Address (Auto-loaded)
From `deployment.json`:
```
0xe23bceaed51c4268300174ad8cd4d4f27750b53a5ef41277defa9f28898b5ebd
```

## 🎯 Example Flow

```
1. Browser shows 4 boxes: User → M1 → M2 → M3

2. Enter recipient address, click "Create Transaction"
   → User box lights up yellow
   → Shows "📱 Transaction Ready"

3. Click Merchant 1 box
   → User box turns green ✅
   → Merchant 1 lights up yellow
   → Shows "📦 Transaction Here"

4. Click Merchant 2 box
   → Merchant 1 turns green ✅
   → Merchant 2 lights up yellow

5. Click Merchant 3 box (the online one)
   → 🌐 BROADCASTS TO APTOS DEVNET!
   → Wait 2-5 seconds...
   → ✅ Transaction Confirmed!
   → Explorer link appears

6. Click "View on Explorer" link
   → See your transaction on Aptos blockchain
   → Verify 0.1 APT transferred
   → See transaction hash, gas used, etc.

7. Your balance in top-right updates automatically
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### 🔥 This Uses REAL Transactions!
- Your account balance will decrease by 0.1 APT (+ gas)
- Transactions are permanent on blockchain
- Make sure you have enough Devnet APT

### 🔐 Private Key Security
- Currently hardcoded for demo
- **DO NOT use this key on mainnet**
- **DO NOT commit private keys to public repos**

### 🌐 Network Requirements
- Backend must connect to Aptos Devnet RPC
- Frontend must connect to backend API (localhost:3001)
- You need internet for the broadcast step

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start
```bash
# Make sure dependencies are installed
cd backend
npm install

# Check port 3001 is free
# Then start server
npm run server
```

### Frontend won't start
```bash
# Install dependencies
cd frontend
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev
```

### "Failed to create transaction"
- Check your balance (need > 0.15 APT)
- Verify recipient address format
- Check backend server is running

### "CORS error"
- Backend must be on port 3001
- Frontend must be on port 3000
- Both servers must be running

---

## 📊 Monitoring

### Watch Backend Logs
The backend terminal shows:
```
[API] Creating transaction...
  Sender: 0xe23b...
  Recipient: 0xabc...
  Amount: 0.1 APT

```

### Watch Frontend UI
- Balance updates in real-time
- Nodes change color as transaction moves
- Status messages update at each step
- Explorer link appears after broadcast
