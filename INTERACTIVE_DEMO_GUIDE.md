## 💡 **Demo Tips for Judges**

### **Emphasize These Points:**

1. **Offline-First with Smart Safeguards**: 
   - "Notice how signature verification happens locally—no network needed"
   - "But the smart seller waits for blockchain confirmation before releasing high-value goods"
   - "This prevents the buyer from running away before payment settles"

2. **Mesh Network**:
   - "The payment hops through offline merchants until it reaches internet connectivity"
   - "This enables rural commerce, disaster relief, and unreliable network scenarios"

3. **Security**:
   - "The smart contract uses nonces to prevent double-spending"
   - "Once a transaction is used, the nonce is recorded on-chain"
   - "Any attempt to reuse it gets rejected—mathematically impossible to bypass"

4. **Real Aptos Integration**:
   - "This isn't a simulation—it's a REAL transaction on Aptos Devnet"
   - "Click the explorer link to see the transaction on-chain"

### **Common Questions & Answers:**

**Q: What if someone never forwards the transaction?**
- A: Sellers can set expiry times and only release valuable goods after blockchain confirmation.

**Q: How does the seller trust the offline signature?**
- A: Ed25519 signatures are cryptographically secure. The seller verifies the buyer actually signed it.

**Q: What about network partitions?**
- A: Transactions queue up and get broadcast when connectivity is restored. Smart contract prevents duplicates.

**Q: Why Aptos?**
- A: Sub-second finality, low fees, parallel execution, and powerful Move language for security.
