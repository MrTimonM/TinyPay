## 🎯 Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

> "TinyPay enables cryptocurrency payments **without internet**. Users sign transactions offline, merchants verify them cryptographically, and payments can be forwarded between multiple offline nodes before final settlement on Aptos blockchain. Our Move smart contract prevents double-spending using nonce-based validation. Perfect for rural commerce, disaster relief, or any scenario with unreliable connectivity."

---

## 💡 Key Features to Highlight

1. ✅ **Offline Transaction Creation** - Ed25519 signatures, no network needed
2. ✅ **Offline Verification** - Merchants validate locally
3. ✅ **Mesh Forwarding** - Payments hop between offline merchants
4. ✅ **On-Chain Settlement** - Final merchant broadcasts to Aptos
5. ✅ **Double-Spend Prevention** - Nonce tracking in Move contract
6. ✅ **Beautiful GUI** - Animated visualization with React + Framer Motion

- Click **"▶️ Start Payment Flow"**
- Watch animation:
  - User signs (offline)
  - Merchant1 verifies (offline)
  - Merchant2 forwards (offline)
  - Merchant3 broadcasts (online)
  - Transaction confirmed ✅
- Click **"🚫 Attempt Double-Spend"**
- Show rejection ❌

### Slide 4: On-Chain Verification (20s)
- Open Aptos Explorer link
- Show deployed contract
- Show transaction history
- "All verifiable on-chain"

### Slide 5: Technical Highlights (10s)
- Move smart contract with nonce protection
- TypeScript backend with Aptos SDK
- React frontend with animations
- Production-ready code

---

## 🔑 Technical Talking Points

### Smart Contract
- "Move contract at `0xe23b...` on Aptos Devnet"
- "Uses `Table<address, SimpleMap<u64, bool>>` for nonce tracking"
- "Each sender has isolated nonce space"
- "Contract enforces: check → mark → transfer"

### Backend
- "TypeScript with @aptos-labs/ts-sdk"
- "Ed25519 signatures for offline signing"
- "Transaction serialization for portability"
- "Merchant forwarding preserves original signature"

### Frontend
- "React 18 with Vite for fast builds"
- "TailwindCSS for modern styling"
- "Framer Motion for smooth animations"
- "TypeScript for type safety"

---

## 📊 Stats to Mention

- **Lines of Code:** ~3,500+
- **Components:** 6 React components, 6 backend modules, 1 Move contract
- **Deployment Time:** Instant (already deployed)
- **Transaction Time:** 2-5 seconds on Devnet
- **Offline TX Creation:** < 100ms
- **Documentation:** 5 comprehensive guides

## 🎯 Q&A Preparation

### "How does offline verification work?"
> "We use Ed25519 cryptographic signatures. The transaction is signed with the user's private key offline. Merchants can verify the signature locally using the public key, without any network calls."

### "What prevents double-spending?"
> "Each transaction includes a nonce. Our Move smart contract tracks used nonces per sender in a `Table` structure. If a nonce is reused, the contract rejects the transaction with error `E_NONCE_ALREADY_USED`."

### "How do merchants get paid if they're offline?"
> "Merchants accept the signed transaction as a promise. They can verify it's valid cryptographically. Later, when any merchant in the chain connects to internet, they broadcast the transaction for on-chain settlement."

### "What if the transaction never gets broadcast?"
> "The merchant can hold the signed transaction and broadcast it themselves when they get connectivity. Or they can forward it to another merchant who has internet. The signature remains valid."

### "Can the transaction be modified during forwarding?"
> "No. The signature covers the entire transaction data (sender, recipient, amount, nonce). Any modification would invalidate the signature, which merchants check before accepting."

### "What happens if two merchants broadcast the same transaction?"
> "Only the first one succeeds. The smart contract marks the nonce as used after the first settlement. The second broadcast is rejected with a double-spend error."

## 🛠️ If Something Goes Wrong

### Demo Won't Start
```bash
# Reinstall dependencies
npm run setup

# Or manually
cd backend && npm install
cd ../frontend && npm install
```

### Port Already in Use
```bash
# Kill process on port 3000 (frontend)
npx kill-port 3000

# Or change port in frontend/vite.config.ts
```

### Contract Not Found
- Contract is deployed at: `0xe23bceaed51c4268300174ad8cd4d4f27750b53a5ef41277defa9f28898b5ebd`
- Check `deployment.json` for details
- Show Explorer link as backup

## 🎤 Opening Statement

> "Hi judges! I'm excited to present **TinyPay** - a solution for cryptocurrency payments in offline environments. We've built a complete system with a Move smart contract deployed on Aptos Devnet, a TypeScript backend for offline signing and verification, and a beautiful React GUI to visualize the flow. Let me show you how it works..."

---

## 🏁 Closing Statement

> "In summary, TinyPay solves a real-world problem - enabling crypto payments without reliable internet. We've demonstrated offline signing, cryptographic verification, mesh forwarding, and double-spend prevention. The system is fully deployed and working on Aptos Devnet. Thank you, and I'm happy to answer any questions!"
