## 🎯 Script Outline

### INTRO & WELCOME PAGE 1 (0:00 - 0:15)

**[Screen: TinyPay Welcome Modal - Page 1]**

> "Hi judges! I'm excited to present **TinyPay** - a revolutionary offline-first cryptocurrency payment system built on Aptos blockchain."

**[Show Page 1 with stats: 2.6B, <5s, 100%]**

> "Look at these numbers: 2.6 BILLION people worldwide lack reliable internet access."
>
> "But it's not just rural areas - think about government internet shutdowns during protests, natural disasters destroying infrastructure, censorship cutting off connectivity."
>
> "Traditional crypto requires constant online access - leaving billions behind."

**[Point to the Solution section]**

> "TinyPay changes this. We enable COMPLETE offline transaction signing, local signature verification, mesh network forwarding, and secure on-chain settlement."

**[Action: Click 'Next: See the Demo Scenarios →']**

---

### WELCOME PAGE 2 - SCENARIOS (0:15 - 0:30)

**[Screen: Page 2 showing both scenarios]**

> "I'll show you two interactive scenarios to prove this works:"

**[Point to Scenario 1]**

> "First - an honest purchase where a buyer gets a phone completely offline, and the seller gets confirmed payment on-chain."

**[Point to Scenario 2]**

> "Second - a security test where a dishonest buyer tries to double-spend, and our Move smart contract BLOCKS it."

**[Action: Click '▶️ Start Demo - Begin with Scenario 1 →']**

---

### SCENARIO 1: HONEST PURCHASE - INTERACTIVE DEMO (0:30 - 1:30)

**[Screen: Scenario selection - Click 'Scenario 1: Honest Purchase' card]**

> "Let's see this in action. I'll click through each step so you see the REAL flow."

**[Screen: Interactive node boxes appear with story context]**

> "Here's the scenario: A buyer wants to purchase a phone for 0.1 APT. The seller wants payment proof first."

#### Click 1: Buyer Creates Payment (0:35 - 0:50)

**[Action: Click the 'Buyer 👤' box]**

> "I'm clicking the Buyer - watch this: The transaction is being signed COMPLETELY OFFLINE. No internet whatsoever!"

**[Screen: Transaction creation happening, nonce generated]**

> "Ed25519 signature created. Cryptographic proof that this buyer approved this payment. All offline!"

#### Click 2: Seller Verifies Signature (0:50 - 1:05)

**[Action: Click the 'Seller 🏪' box]**

> "Now I click the Seller - they verify the signature locally. Still no internet!"

**[Screen: Seller shows "Signature valid! Waiting for confirmation..."]**

> "VERIFIED! The cryptographic signature is valid - this proves the buyer authorized the payment. But here's the smart part: the seller WAITS for blockchain confirmation before releasing the phone. This prevents the buyer from running away with goods before payment settles!"

#### Click 3: Forward Through Network (1:05 - 1:20)

**[Action: Click the 'Village Hub 🏬' box]**

> "Now the seller forwards the signed payment through the mesh network..."

**[Screen: Payment forwarding animation]**

> "The Village Hub gets it... Now clicking the City Gateway..."

**[Action: Click the 'City Gateway 🏦' box]**

> "And THIS node has internet! It's broadcasting to Aptos blockchain RIGHT NOW!"

#### Blockchain Confirmation & Goods Release (1:20 - 1:30)

**[Screen: Transaction confirmed, "Goods Released ✅" appears]**

> "BOOM! Confirmed on Aptos in under 5 seconds! NOW the seller releases the phone!"

**[Screen: Goods animation, buyer receives phone]**

> "Payment confirmed on-chain → Goods released safely! The seller has cryptographic proof, and the buyer can't run away with the goods before payment settles. This is SMART offline commerce!"

**[Hover over/click explorer link]**

> "And this is REAL - click the explorer link to verify on Aptos Devnet!"

---

### TRANSITION TO SCENARIO 2 (1:30 - 1:35)

**[Screen: Big button appears: "▶️ Next: Scenario 2 - Double-Spend Attempt"]**

> "Perfect! Honest commerce works. But what if someone tries to CHEAT?"

**[Action: Click the 'Next: Scenario 2' button]**

---

### SCENARIO 2: DOUBLE-SPEND ATTEMPT - SECURITY DEMO (1:35 - 2:20)

**[Screen: Scenario 2 starts, dishonest buyer shown]**

> "Watch this: A dishonest buyer tries to REUSE the exact same payment with a different seller. Same nonce, same signature!"

#### Click 1: Buyer Attempts Reuse (1:40 - 1:50)

**[Action: Click the 'Buyer 👤' box]**

> "Clicking the buyer - they're trying to spend the same 0.1 APT again!"

**[Screen: Same transaction being presented]**

#### Click 2: New Seller Verifies (1:50 - 2:00)

**[Action: Click the 'Seller 🏪' box]**

> "New seller verifies the signature offline - it looks VALID! The signature is mathematically correct!"

**[Screen: "Signature valid! Waiting for confirmation..." shown]**

> "The seller sees a valid signature, BUT - being smart - they wait for blockchain confirmation before releasing goods. The dishonest buyer is waiting, hoping to grab goods and run..."

#### Click 3 & 4: Network Forwarding (2:00 - 2:10)

**[Action: Click 'Village Hub 🏬' box]**

> "Payment forwards through the network again..."

**[Action: Click 'City Gateway 🏦' box]**

> "Reaches the blockchain for broadcasting..."

#### Blockchain REJECTS! (2:10 - 2:20)

**[Screen: "🚫 BLOCKCHAIN REJECTED! NO GOODS RELEASED!" message]**

> "BLOCKED! The Aptos Move smart contract detected the REUSED NONCE and REJECTED the transaction!"

**[Screen: Error message: "NONCE_ALREADY_USED", seller shows "No confirmation = No goods!"]**

> "The seller sees 'Payment FAILED!' - NO blockchain confirmation means NO goods released! The seller is completely protected!"
>
> "The dishonest buyer can't run away with anything because the smart seller waited for on-chain confirmation. This is blockchain security you can TRUST - cryptographically impossible to bypass!"

### IMPACT & CLOSING (2:20 - 3:00)

**[Screen: Both scenarios completed]**

> "Let's recap what you just witnessed:"

**[Point to the scenarios]**

> "Scenario 1: REAL commerce working completely offline - buyer got goods, seller got confirmed payment on Aptos blockchain."
>
> "Scenario 2: BULLETPROOF security - our Move smart contract preventing fraud with nonce-based replay protection."

**[Screen: Hover over 'ℹ️ About' button to show stats again]**

> "The impact here is MASSIVE:"

**[Show stats]**

> - "2.6 BILLION people can now access crypto payments"
> - "Works during government shutdowns and natural disasters"  
> - "100% offline capable until final settlement"
> - "Sub-5-second finality on Aptos"
> - "Cryptographically secure - impossible to fake"

**[Screen: Show full interface]**

> "Think about the use cases:"
> - "Rural areas with no internet infrastructure"
> - "Countries with frequent internet censorship"
> - "Disaster zones where communication fails"
> - "Cross-border remittances without intermediaries"

**[Screen: Click explorer link one more time]**

> "And remember - this isn't vaporware! Every transaction you saw is REAL, deployed on Aptos Devnet, verifiable on Aptos Explorer right now!"

**[Screen: Show contract address and deployment info]**

> "Built with Move smart contracts, Aptos TypeScript SDK, and industry-standard Ed25519 cryptography."
